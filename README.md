# Maze Solver [1.0] Alpha

A simple brute-forcing maze solving application I've made for fun. 

## Future updates

The application is currently in its alpha state without a UI, and currently utilizing a brute forcing method. In the future updates more efficient code will be present with efficient algorithms (A* is planned), as well as a user-friendly UI.
